Multilingual Global Exams 

This repository contains exam processing scripts for the Aya Expedition's Global Exams project. Language-specific OCR pipeline scripts will be added to this repository as they are developed. 

To get started, the ```any_language``` directory contains scripts that can process exams in any language and can serve as a useful starting point for developing language-specific OCR pipelines.

Directory structure:
```
main
├── any_language
├── hindi
├── french
├── italian
├── bengali
└── (rest of the languages)
```


Special thanks to Angelika, Negar and Anna for the ```any_language``` scripts!
